# redux-domino
An intuitive way to handle async control flow with redux.  
You could easily write this yourself, but you don't have to.

## build
1. npm install
2. npm run build

## test
1. npm test

## timing

Do you want the action handlers to be called before or after the state has been updated by the reducers?  

Apply your redux middleware in the order you want them to execute.
